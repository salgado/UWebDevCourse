<!-- Analysing the strcuture of an HTML page -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. 
    For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard. -->

<head>
    <!-- The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page.
Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page.
Unlike the information inside of the <body> tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself. -->

<title>Page Title</title>
<!-- A browser’s tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>. -->
<body>
    <!-- Once the file has a body, many different types of content – including text, images, and buttons – can be added to the body. -->

</body>
</head>

<!-- Semantic Elements -->

<!-- Structure elements allow you to organize the main parts of your page. They usually contain other HTML elements. -->

<!-- Here’s what a typical webpage could include: -->

<header> as the first element of the page, that can include the logo and the tagline.
<nav> as a list of links that go to the different pages of the website.
<h1> as the title of the page.
<article> as the main content of the page, like a blog post.
<footer> as the last element of the page, located at the bottom.
