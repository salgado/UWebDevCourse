                <p class=" card-text" id="style-2">In May 2019, Apple introduced refreshed MacBook Pro models with new
                    8th and 9th-generation Intel processors, which the company says are its fastest MacBook Pro models
                    to date. In July 2019, Apple also updated its entry-level MacBook Pro, which hadn't been refreshed
                    since 2017. The new entry-level machine features 8th-generation Intel processors, a Touch Bar, Touch
                    ID, and a T2 Security Chip, just like the more expensive 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pro models.
                    With the new update, Apple's entire MacBook Pro lineup has similar specs and features, along with a
                    $1,299 starting point for the base model.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Available in the standard 13 and 15-inch size configurations, the 2019 MacBook Pro models don't
                    feature external changes, continuing to use the same design that was first introduced in 2016, but
                    the new machines feature a few key improvements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All of the new MacBook Pro models use the latest Intel processors, introducing an 8-core option for
                    the 15-inch MacBook Pro for the first time. While the 15-inch models use 6 or 8-core 9th-generation
                    chips, the 13-inch MacBook Pro models are equipped with quad-core 8th-generation chips.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Apple says the new 8-core 15-inch MacBook Pro offers two times faster performance than a quad-core
                    MacBook Pro and 40 percent faster performance than a previous-generation 6-core MacBook Pro.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The other major change to the MacBook Pro concerns the keyboard, which is now using an upgraded
                    butterfly mechanism made from new materials. Apple says this updated keyboard will significantly cut
                    down on key failures that have been prominent in prior MacBook Pro models.
                    Aside from upgraded chips and the new butterfly keyboard that's been introduced, the 2019 MacBook
                    Pro
                    models are the same as the prior-generation 2018 MacBook Pro models.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    13-inch MacBook Pro machines feature Intel Iris Plus Graphics 645 and 655, while 15-inch models are
                    equipped with built-in graphics and either a Radeon Pro 555X/560X graphics or Radeon Pro Vega 16 or
                    20
                    graphics. 4TB of SSD storage is available in the 15-inch machine, while the 13-inch machine can
                    support
                    a 2TB SSD.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Up to 32GB RAM is available in the 15-inch MacBook Pro, while the 13-inch model maxes out at 16GB.
                    An
                    OLED Touch Bar with Touch ID continues to be included along with a larger Force Touch Trackpad. The
                    entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro offers two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports while higher-end 13-inch models
                    and
                    all 15-inch models feature four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Touch Bar and the Retina display of the MacBook Pro feature support for True Tone functionality
                    that
                    adjusts white balance to match ambient lighting, and other display features such as wide color
                    support
                    are included.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A T2 chip continues to offer enhanced security with secure boot and on-the-fly encrypted storage
                    along
                    with support for hands-free Hey Siri commands. All day 10 hour battery life is still supported, and
                    there's a Touch ID button for unlocking your Mac with your fingerprint.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can purchase the new MacBook Pro models in Silver or Space Gray. Bluetooth 5.0, 802.11ac WiFi,
                    stereo speakers with two microphones, and a 720p FaceTime HD Camera are other included features.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pricing on the 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,299 for a 1.4GHz quad-core Core i5 processor, 8GB
                    RAM,
                    and a 128GB SSD, while the middle tier 13-inch MacBook Pro model features a 2.4GHz Core i5
